Conclusion: full-text also behaves poorly in direct match. The accuracy mainly comes from content

Conclusion: Although the full-text doesn't do well enough, but it contributes more to direct search, so in overall it helps vector search and outperforms one single baseline.

So the key is to optimize full-text in direct match in hybrid search

Conclusion: Single TF-IDF with Keyword extraction improves, but when implemented in hybrid search, it's no better than plain one because
This means keyword extraction improves the semantic search in TF-IDF instead of match module code, which is not considered as a keyword in corpus.
And because tf-idf does more poorly in semantic search, so it actually affected the advantage of vector search when searched similar docs but give lower score.
Therefore it only slightly outperforms single vector search with the advantage of keyword math and the disadvantage of encumbering vector search
